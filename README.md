# word2vec
This project proposes as to how we can improve the working of Anusaaraka using Semantic Vectors and Machine Learning Tools. Presently, Anusaaraka does not incorporate the semantic information of the words in a sentence,hence this document proposes the ways in which it can make an attempt to do the same by using word2vec- a tool that computes word vector representations of words which can be used in various natural language processing applications.A tool has been designed that would act as a helping aid to the people who make Word Sense Disambiguation(WSD) Rules. DTREE mechanism also  used in this project which is   made by using a Decision Tree tool which is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.Using decision tree and python programmming we make automatic generated WSD rules using Clips and explore word2vec for better machine translation
